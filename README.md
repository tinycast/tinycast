# tinycast

Tinycast is a little webapp for making high quality peer-to-peer WebRTC calls,
with an emphasis on experiencing audio and video together. Tinycast makes
listening to or watching media together as easy as sharing a link.

Development as of July 2020 is currently paused while I've been working on
[Streamwall](https://streamwall.io).
